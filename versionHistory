Afushell 1.0 is the first version : and the most obvious disadvantage is it use EXECLP(buf,buf,0),so we can only use the command like "ls" that without any arguments.

Afushell 2.0 is the second version: and it use EXECVP(argulist[0],argulist),so commands like "find" that use arguments can work well. but when i use it as the login shell ,it give too little function as expected. FOR example,we can't operate with dirctions like "cd" command,and we can't use the backspace key when we want to change our input.

Afushell 3.0 is the third version: i have serched a myshell version of cannium from the github.and because of  that i have learned how to deal with the environment valiables and how to make the buildin commands such as "cd" "echo" etc.And the way cannium use to parser the command is brilliant, i'm thinking use it in the future version. However the way cannium use to handle signal is not so good ,i think.
Afushell 4.0 is the fourth version: there are more advantages in it such as the supporting of pipe and the editable of the command line.It  becomes more usable.
